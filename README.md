The light meter project seeks to address the issue of detecting the correct exposure settings while clicking a photograph from an SLR camera or any camera

# Brief Description about Photography settings:
Photography is all about light. Photography is combination of science and art. It is all about the capturing what you see. In order to do that,you need to let the camera see what you wish. A camera is like a tool which helps you control how much light reaches the sensor. It does this by giving you access to aperture and shutter speed.To put it in simple words:
1)How large the hole is. The larger the hole, more you see–(Aperture a.k.a F-stop)
2)How long you look. The more you look the more details you notice(how fast/slow the shutter of sensor opens and closes therebyallowing the amount of light falling on the camera sensor)
ISO setting dictates the granularity of the image. For our project we assume ISO 100 for all values. Even in real life we don’t change ISO settings as much we change the F-stop and shutter speed values.
